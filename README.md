> Is twitter hivemind kind or crude?

This is a social experiment to check how is twitter (as a network) acting right now. Are most of the tweets happy? Are most of the people using crude words? See for yourself [here](https://kind-or-crude.glitch.me)

kind-or-crude taps into twitter streaming API, pulls tweets and depending upon the words in those tweets, divides them into kind or crude category. It then paints a beautiful canvas in real-time.
